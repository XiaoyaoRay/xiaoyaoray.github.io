## From [Multiple Remote Desktop (RDP) Connections](https://www.hostwinds.com/guide/allow-multiple-remote-desktop-rdp-connections-in-windows-server-2012-2016/)

This guide will explain how to allow multiple sessions in a Windows VPS. A common usage case for this would be to allow the usage of a developed application or a remotely accessed support desktop. Additionally, there will be some information on where to purchase the RDS CAL license directly from Microsoft to allow for a larger number of users.

If you need more than 2 connections to your Windows Server 2016 from internal device, then, below RDS serve role might be necessary:
1. RD Connection Broker.
2. RD Session Host.
3. RD Licensing server â€“ there is 120-day licensing grace period, appropriate RDS CALs should be purchased and installed before it has expired.

*It may be best to consider a higher specification VPS or a Dedicated Server if you wish to use more than 3 users per machine, as the overall performance of the VPS will degrade per user.*

**Step 8.** Next, click Next Setting until you are at the **Restrict Remote Desktop Services users to a single Remote Desktop Services session** screen so you can Edit this setting.

 ![This window is simpler, and requests for you to enable, disable, or leave unconfigured. To allow more than once user, you can set it to enabled.](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1g3nzmazghaj30j40hqmxp.jpg)



**Step 9.** In this window, you can click ***Disabled*** to turn off the user restrictions.
